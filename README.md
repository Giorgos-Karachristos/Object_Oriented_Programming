# Object-Oriented Programming
This repository contains the solutions to the exercises from the lab Object-Oriented Programming

## Coding Rules:
These are the rules I follow when implementing the exercises:
1. I follow the description of each exercise exactly.
2. All print outputs are written in English.
3. I use getter methods to access private variables only when additional logic is required (e.g., calculation or validation). If no logic is needed, I access the variable directly within the class.
